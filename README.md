# Fake-news-detection-using-machine-learning
Our study explores different textual properties that can be used to distinguish fake contents from real.

This project could be practically used by any media company to automatically predict whether the circulating news is fake or not. The process could be done automatically without having humans manually review thousands of news related articles.

Learn step-by-step

1.Understand the Problem Statement and business case 

2.Import libraries and datasets

3.Perform Exploratory Data Analysis

4.Perform Data Cleaning

5.Visualize the cleaned data

6.Prepare the data by tokenizing and padding

7.Understand the theory and intuition behind Recurrent Neural Networks

8.Understand the theory and intuition behind LSTM
